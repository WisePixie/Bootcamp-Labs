            <br>
        
            <p>In 2020, I came across a free hour long webinar that outlined basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since then, I have been teaching myself web development. I searched and worked on multiple projects to gain an understanding of the different software languages and IDEâ€™s. April 2024 I enrolled in the Grand Circus C#.NET 28-week after hours bootcamp. I code daily to help develop my skill set further. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Staying busy is a MUST for me! Along with web development, I have multiple other hobbies. Which include 3D printing, crocheting, hinking, kayaking, painting, wire wrapping and so much more. </p>
            <br>

            <p>Sterling Heights, Michigan is my childhood hometown. Basically every weekend when I was younger my parents and I went camping in Oxford. The campground gave me a place to explore, love and find people I now consider family.</p>
